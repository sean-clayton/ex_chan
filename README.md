# ExChan

A simple image board written in Elixir.

### Motivation

I just wanted to create some projects that helped me learn idiomatic Elixir.
I figured a *Chan clone would be a good starting point.

### Features

For the most part, I tried to mimic 4chan to feature-parity.
Unfortunately I don't know what kind of admin/moderation tools they have so I'm winging that part.
As far as a regular user, though, it should be toe-to-toe in terms of capability.
It's also a lot faster.
